# How to start
First of all, you need to download Chai3d library and compile the sources. 

Chai3D comes with several templates : dotNet, GLUT, and QT. For the purpose of this project, we worked on the basis provided by the Glut template.

Copy-Paste a Glut template and inject inside the source code present on this Github repository.

The resources directory has to be injected in the bin folder of Chai3D library.

That's it, compile, run, and enjoy !
